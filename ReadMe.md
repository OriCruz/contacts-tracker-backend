# Contacts Tracker (backend)
This full stack application keeps track of all your contacts' First and last names as well as their phone number and a desired image. 
This app is the back-end of the application, which takes care of everything that happends behind the scene like, connecting to the databse (MongoDB), recieves the call/request from the browser and sends a response out with the information requested.

## Unsolved problems and Future Enhancements
At the moment I can't see any unsolved issues on the backend side of this project, though I would like to change the file structure for it to be a bit cleaner.
Also I would like to implement another model for users to login and display their invidual list of contacts.
